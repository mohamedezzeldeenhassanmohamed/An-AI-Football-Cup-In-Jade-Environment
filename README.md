The idea:

A football cup tournament is set to take place, involving a total of 16 teams competing for the title. 

Before any match is played between two teams, a central agent will communicate essential information to the agents of both teams.

This information will be crucial for initiating the match and will include 

the following details:

1. The scheduled time for the match, ensuring that both teams are prepared and present.
2. The identity of the opposing team, allowing each team to strategize and plan accordingly.
3. The specific location or playground where the match will be held, providing clarity on the venue for both teams and their supporters. 

This structured approach aims to facilitate smooth communication and organization throughout the tournament.

#****# This cup will play a game starting with 16 teams, narrowing down to 8, then 4, then 2, and finally determining the winner.
